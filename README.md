# Ball Tracking & Recognition

This project uses computer vision to track the movement of balls of different colors across various quadrants in a video. The program records the events of each ball entering and exiting each numbered quadrant, and outputs the results as a processed video and a text file.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ball-tracking-recognition.git
    cd ball-tracking-recognition
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Download the input video:**
    Download the video from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1goI3aHVE29Gko9lpTzgi_g3CZZPjJq8w/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the project directory.

2. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python track_balls.py
    ```

    This will process the video and generate an output video and a text file with the recorded events.

## Output

- **Processed Video:**
    The processed video will show the ball tracking with color and overlay text "Entry" or "Exit" along with the timestamp at the time of entry/exit of a numbered quadrant.

- **Text File:**
    The text file will contain records in the following format:
    ```
    Time, Quadrant Number, Ball Colour, Event Type (Entry or Exit)
    ```

    Example:
    ```
    1.23, 1, orange, Entry
    2.45, 2, green, Exit
    ```

## Example
